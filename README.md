# child-homicide-project


I am working on a in-depth project about child homicide in the USA, and the role social services and other entities such as family courts play in trying to provide a safe space to children at risk. Nationally, almost half of the children killed every year are known by the Child Protective Services (CPC) agencies, but and few evidence-based pograms and a lack of proper data, among other factors, means that children that could have been protected ended up being murdered.

 <h5>Data used </h5>
The data used come from a dataset created by the nonprofit Murder Accountability Project (MAP), focused on tracking down unsolved homicides, that complements the FBI Supplementary Homicide Report (SHR).
The first graph was created after having manually collected relevant data from previous Arizona annual Child Fatality Reviews, in which is analyzed how many of the families that commits infanticide had a prior report or an open investigation when the murder happened. 

Finally, I designed the vizualizations using RawGraphs, and editing them on Adobe Illustrator.
